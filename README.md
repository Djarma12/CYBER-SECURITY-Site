## Description

The beginning when I started dealing with frontend development was here. I started watching tutorials on YouTube, where I learned some basics of html and css, where I typed with the man who filmed the tutorial. I saw for myself that this is a very powerful thing, I liked it and still continued to grab. Since I had very little knowledge, this project is not fully responsive.

#### Technologies

- HTML
- CSS
- JS
